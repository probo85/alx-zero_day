Markdowns
=======

How surprisingly amazing they are!
-----------

This is my _very first_ introduction to **Markdown** texts.

Markdowns are `awesome!!`

Human Readable! A supremely desirable quality!

Enough with the chitchat, this repo is used for completing **zero_day projects** or the first couple of projects of the first week of the first day.
The projects listed here are supposed to help us get familiar with:

  * git
  * vi
  * vagrant
  * emacs
